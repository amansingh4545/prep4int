                    A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data,
                     and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.

                <p>Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
                    These data structure are in various forms, such as an array, tree, graph, or linked list.
                    there are two types of searching algo- linear search and binary search

                <p>Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
                    The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, 
                    comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.</p>

                    called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their 
                    own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.</p>

                <p>Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over recursion. Wherever we see a recursive 
                    solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
                     The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute 
                     them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential 
                     to polynomial.</p>
